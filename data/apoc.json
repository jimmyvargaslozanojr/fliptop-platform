  "description": "Apoc was part of the inaugural Grain Assault event, and while he lost his first few battles due to chokes, he was able to bounce back at Aspakan 1 by verbally demolishing Sayantipiko. Since then, he ascended to the top and has no plans of climbing down. Apoc is one of the first in the league to utilize wordplays, metaphors, and similes, and he spits them all with confidence and aggression.",
