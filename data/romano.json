  "description": "Hailing from Cabanatuan, Romano instantly won the hearts of fans upon his FlipTop debut. His jokes may be less complex than others, but his aggressive delivery makes them effective. Another notable strength of his is his freestyle skill. Despite forgetting his writtens in his Ahon 5 battle against Makii, he still emerged victorious thanks to his ability to spit off-the-top. Romano proved his top tier status when he became a finalist at the 2015 Isabuhay Tournament and a semi-finalist at the Dos Por Dos with J-King.",
