  "description": "Invictus is one of the emcees that lifted the “Basta Gapo, bano” curse. He joined the 2015 Process of Illumination in Central Luzon, and even though he didn’t become the champion, his hard-hitting performance landed him a spot in the league’s roster. Apart from his aggressive delivery, Invictus is also famous for his complex (and often overlooked) wordplays and brutal lines. He’s always in top form in every battle; proof of this is when he joined the 2023 Isabuhay Tournament. Invictus faced Hazky in the finals and dominantly won the championship.",
