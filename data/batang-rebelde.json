  "description": "Batang Rebelde made his FlipTop debut in December of 2011, scoring an impressive victory against Jonas. He then joined the first Dos Por Dos Tournament with Rapido and even though they lost the first round, the crowd still enjoyed their performance. The Tanza-based rapper continued his solo battling career, showcasing his unique blend of humor and technical bars. This style can be seen in full force in his battle versus Frooz at 2017’s Zoning event.",
