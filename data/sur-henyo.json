  "description": "Sur Henyo was part of the 2015 Process of Illumination in Central Luzon and his impressive showing was enough to get him a spot in FlipTop. He lost his first two battles, but was able to bounce back at the 2017 Isabuhay tournament. His improved pen game and delivery led him to the finals against crowd-favorite Mhot. Despite losing the aforementioned battle, he still managed to get the respect of battle rap fans and fellow emcees. Now, Sur Henyo is well-known not only for his technical bars and confidence but also for his clever angles.",
