  "description": "Tweng may be well-known for using different props in battles, but he’s more than that. His unorthodox rhymes and Spoken Word-type delivery also make him truly a one-of-a-kind emcee. The use of props is far from gimmicky, since it’s still related to his opponents. Indeed, no one in the league can combine battle rhymes and performance art like him.",
