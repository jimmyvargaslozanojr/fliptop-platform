  "description": "G-Clown made his FlipTop debut at Kataga, beating J-Lem with his swift flow, aggressive delivery, and complex multis. His trademark style clicked with the audience, and he improved it further in his next battles. At the first round of the 2016 Isabuhay Tournament, he went face-to-face with the very popular Loonie. He may have lost, but many consider it to be his best performance in FlipTop. In 2019, he once again joined the tournament and was able to reach the semi-finals. G-Clown is also highly skilled when it comes to jokes. Watch his match against Frooz and expect to laugh out loud from the first to the third round.",
