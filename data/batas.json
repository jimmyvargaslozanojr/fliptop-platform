  "description": "Batas is one of the first emcees to step foot in the FlipTop stage, and his hardcore approach made him the two-time Isabuhay champion. When you go face-to-face with him, you better expect plenty of hurtful words from the first to the last round. Batas spits his venomous rhymes with an aggressive flow and delivery that will leave the viewers wanting more. He has plenty of classic battles under his belt, but the one with Dello remains to be the most well-known. It’s where he was hailed as the official “bad guy” of the league.",
