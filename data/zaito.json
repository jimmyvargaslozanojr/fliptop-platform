  "description": "Even before the league started, Zaito is already regarded one of the best freestylers in the Philippines. He was so impressive on the mic that FlipTop invited him to its first Ahon event. Despite losing against Loonie, Zaito still received plenty of praise for his entertaining off-the-top rhymes. He then started to adjust to the modern format of battling and eventually became a fan favorite.",
