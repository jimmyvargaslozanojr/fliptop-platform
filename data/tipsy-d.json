  "description": "When it comes to “bars”, Tipsy D is one of the first names that come to mind. After impressing the audience at Gapo De Gulat 2, he continued to improve his pen game. His multis, wordplays and metaphors are combined with a confident delivery, thus making him a formidable opponent.",
