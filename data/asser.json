  "description": "Asser started out at the Ubec Mindfields Tryouts, where he was crowned the champion. In his debut battle at Gubat 1, he proved that he truly belongs in the league. If you go one-on-one with Asser, expect him to break your rapping style down in the most creative why. He will expose all of your weaknesses using well-written multis and a fast-paced flow.",
