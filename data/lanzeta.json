  "description": "Just like Invictus, Lanzeta also helped Olongapo rise up from all the hate. He first appeared at the Central Luzon Process of Illumination in 2015, where he became champion. Since then, he has been leaving audiences in awe with his rapid fire flow and intricately-constructed bars. The raw aggression in his delivery also makes him stand out from FlipTop’s roster.",
