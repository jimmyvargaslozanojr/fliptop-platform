  "description": "Abra was already a well-known freestyler in the late 2000’s, so when FlipTop was established, he immediately got a spot in its roster. He lost his debut battle, but was able to bounce back at the inaugural Bwelta Balentong event. Abra immediately turned into a fan favorite thanks to his clever jokes, impressive speedy flow, and well-constructed multi-syllabic rhymes.",
