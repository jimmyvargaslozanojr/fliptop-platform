  "description": "BLKD joined the first FlipTop tryout in 2010, and even though he wasn’t able to reach the finals, his performance earned him a spot in the roster. Fast forward to the present, the Cavite-born emcee has become synonymous with “bars”. While the concept was already introduced earlier in the league, it was him who made the technical style popular among fans.",
