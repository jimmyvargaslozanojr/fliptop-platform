  "description": "Tatz Maven’s skill as an emcee and producer was enough for the people behind FlipTop to make him part of the roster. In his debut battle against Dosage, the emcee from GenSan proved that he belongs in the league. Apart from the confidence in his delivery, he also wowed the crowd with his intricate rhyme schemes and metaphors.",
