  "description": "Arguably the most sinister voice in Philippine battle rap, Sayadd quickly made an impact at the very first Process of Illumination. His menacing delivery blends well with his intricate bars and rhyme schemes. He’s also renowned for his unpredictable angles, making even the most skilled freestyler struggle to come up with rebuttals.",
