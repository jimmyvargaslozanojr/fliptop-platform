  "description": "Rapido’s first appearance was at Bara Ko, Barako in 2011, where he won against Papew by unanimous decision. His performance was solid indeed, but it was his clash with CrazyMix at Kataga that made him popular among FlipTop fans. At the aforementioned match, he displayed his undeniable skill in speed rapping. Making his flow even more effective are his clever bars and jokes. In 2013, he teamed up with Icaruz at the Dos Por Dos Tournament and even though they lost at the semi-finals, their performance was still met with applause.",
