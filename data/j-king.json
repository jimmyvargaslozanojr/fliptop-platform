  "description": "On the 7th of August 2015, J-King travelled from Cabanatuan to Metro Manila just to participate at the 5th Process of Illumination. Now that’s what you call dedication. He showed his supreme freestyling skills and ended up winning the whole thing. J-King proved that he wasn’t a fluke when he finally debuted at Aspakan 3. His comedic delivery and brilliant mixture of jokes and technical lines quickly made him a fan favorite.",
