  "description": "Frooz debuted at the inaugural Dos Por Dos Tournament in 2012 with Elbiz. They lost at the quarterfinals, but in 2013, they joined again and became the champions. Frooz also made a huge impact in FlipTop as a solo emcee. In every match that he’s in, he always mixes technical lines with creative humor. Battle rap fans got hooked to his style when he went one-on-one with Silencer.",
