  "description": "Shernan definitely knows how to entertain the crowd. Despite not reaching the finals of Process of Illumination 4, he was still accepted in the league thanks to his brilliant performance. He instantly became famous not only for his mixture of bars and jokes, but also for his creative gimmicks. When he steps on stage, expect Shernan to wear a costume that fits the mood of the battle.",
