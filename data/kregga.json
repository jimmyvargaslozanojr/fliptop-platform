  "description": "Kregga first made his presence felt in 2013 at the FlipTop Mindanao tryouts. The Cagayan de Oro native immediately stood out thanks to his wide vocabulary. He spits these complex lines with a relatively calm delivery, which adds to his uniqueness. Kregga proved that he’s a lyrical threat when he faced Cerberus at Ahon 6 and got the W. Since then, he remains one of the most renowned technical emcees in the league.",
