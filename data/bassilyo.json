  "description": "If you’re a Pinoy rap fan, then you’ve probably heard of Bassilyo even before FlipTop. He and his group Crazy as Pinoy enjoyed moderate success in the early 2000’s when they joined the Rap Public contest in Eat Bulaga. In 2012, he decided to give FlipTop a shot by participating at the first Dos Por Dos with his friend CrazyMix. Despite losing at the quarterfinals, their incredible chemistry and performance made them fan favorites in an instant. The duo had a better showing at the 2013 tournament, where they were able to reach the finals.",
