  "description": "Loonie made his FlipTop debut at the first Second Sight event, and he already proved that he’s a top-tier emcee. A few rappers attempted to copy his signature multisyllabic rhymes, but he remains to be the best to do it. His impressive skill set and charisma are what made him the most viewed in the whole world. Loonie also has the capability to come up with clever angles, which can be seen in his battle against Tipsy D at Bwelta Balentong 3. He then cemented his legacy as one of the greatest when he became the Isabuhay Champion in 2016.",
