  "description": "Spade, now known as Goriong Talas, immediately became well-known after winning the inaugural FlipTop tryouts in 2010. In his debut at Down N South, he was able to showcase his raw aggression and complex rhymes. Casual fans usually overlook his pen game, but once you dissect his lines, you will see how creative and lethal he is. The 2021 Isabuhay Tournament saw Talas in his most effective form yet. He took on J-Blaque in the finals and despite not winning the championship, his performance was still widely-acclaimed.",
