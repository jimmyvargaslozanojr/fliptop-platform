  "description": "Poison 13 stood out at the Process of Illumination in Central Luzon, and he improved further when he officially became part of FlipTop’s roster. His creative bars and jokes are delivered through impressive multi-syllabic rhymes, making them even more effective. He always comes prepared in his battles, and he has the ability to adapt to whatever style he encounters.",
