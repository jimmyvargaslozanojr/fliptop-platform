  "description": "Pricetagg’s solid lyricism in one of his old tracks impressed the FlipTop staff so much that they decided to give him a battle at the first Zoning event. He took on Badang, and just like his songs, he represented Gangsta Rap to the fullest. After a victorious debut, Pricetagg’s winning streak continued. He was officially declared a top tier emcee when he defeated Batas at Ahon 7.",
