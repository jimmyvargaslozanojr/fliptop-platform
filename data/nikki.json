  "description": "Nikki became part of FlipTop’s roster after giving a remarkable performance at the 2013 Mindfields Tryouts in Mindanao. Fans of the league instantly got hooked to his rhyme schemes and classic Pinoy humor. This unique style of his is fully displayed in his battle against Silent Effect at the second Pakusganay event. His “gwapo bars” trended in social media for a long period of time, proving Nikki’s impact on the viewers.",
