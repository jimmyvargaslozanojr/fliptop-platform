  "description": "Fangs joined the FlipTop roster after impressing everyone at the Ubec Mindfields Tryouts. His first match was against Zeus in the Bisaya Conference, where he emerged victorious in dominating fashion. The Cebuano emcee proceeded to battle in Filipino, and his consecutive wins are proof that his technical rapping style and unique humor works.",
