  "description": "Apekz first appeared at the inaugural Second Sight event, where he took on Harlem in a freestyle battle. He may have lost his FlipTop debut, but he quickly made an epic comeback at Ahon 1, outrapping Snatch for three rounds. From there, Apekz continued his ascent to the top. Apart from his creative jokes, he also became famous for his intricate multis and effective “real talk” bars.",
