  "description": "He may not have won the championship at Process of Illumination 4, but he was still accepted into the main roster thanks to his amazing performance. Tondo’s Pistolero won the hearts of FlipTop fans with his heavy bars and superhuman freestyle skills. No matter how hard your line is, he will strike back with consecutive rebuttals. His clashes with Shehyee at Second Sight 3 and at the 2018 Isabuhay Tournament semi-finals are considered classics. At Ahon 13, he officially became a top-tier emcee by finally winning the Isabuhay Championship.",
