  "description": "There are only a few emcees in FlipTop who can flawlessly rap fast, and Damsa is one of them. While his debut at Down N South in 2010 was a bit unimpressive, he bounced back at Grain Assault 2 using his trademark flow. 2016 was arguably his greatest year thanks to his consecutive victories. If you want to witness Damsa’s impressive flow in full force, then check out his Gubat 5 clash with Flict-G. He eventually teamed up with his aforementioned opponent at the Dos Por Dos Tournament in 2017, where they were able to reach the semi-finals.",
