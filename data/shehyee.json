  "description": "Shehyee debuted at the first Ahon event and is often regarded as one of the most intense emcees in the league. When you’re battling him, you better be prepared to hear plenty of hurtful lines about your professional and personal life. His rhymes are delivered in a very aggressive tone, making them sound even more hard-hitting.",
