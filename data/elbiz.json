  "description": "Elbiz made his first appearance at the inaugural Dos Por Dos with Frooz. They lost at the quarterfinals, but at the second tournament, they were able to bounce back by winning the championship. Their most notable victory was against the tandem of Abra and Apekz. Elbiz debuted as a solo emcee at Aspakan 1, scoring an impressive victory against Jaffie. Whether it’s 1-on-1 or 2-on-2, the QC-born rapper is sure to astound you with his intelligent humor, smooth flow, and well-constructed multis.",
