  "description": "Despite not reaching the finals of the Process of Illumination in Central Luzon, Bataan’s EJ Power was still accepted into the roster thanks to his solid performance. In his debut battle against Rich Flo at Aspakan 3, he showed everyone that he truly belongs in FlipTop. Battle rap fans were astounded by his blend of creative humor and technical rhymes. He’s also impressive when it comes to switching flows. You’ll often see him rap at a moderate pace in the beginning and then, go faster towards the end. His battle with LilJohn at Bwelta Balentong 3 is often considered to be his best performance to date.",
