  "description": "Here’s a trivia, Jonas’ FlipTop debut was actually in 2011 at the Bara Ko, Barako event. He lost his first battle and suddenly fell off the radar. In 2015, Jonas re-emerged at Process of Illumination 5, where he reached the finals. The league once again welcomed him to the roster, and from there, he was able to redeem himself from his 2011 loss.",
