  "description": "Smugglaz is already a renowned rapper even before the birth of FlipTop. So when the league was finally established, he instantly became part of the official roster. He made his debut at Down N South in 2010, where he displayed both his rapid fire flow and intricate rhyming style. Some may say that he only says random words in his lines, but he proved them all wrong when he faced Rapido at Bwelta Balentong 3. The Tondo emcee exposed all of his opponent’s weaknesses without straying from his trademark style. Many fans called it the biggest bodybag of 2016.",
