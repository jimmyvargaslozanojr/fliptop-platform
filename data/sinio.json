  "description": "Sinio quickly established himself as FlipTop’s “joke king” when he first appeared at Gapo De Gulat 2. Whether it’s written or freestyle, his comedic bars always leave a lasting impression. He can also combine his humor with a more serious approach, as seen in his Ahon 7 match against Shehyee. Controversy aside, the aforementioned battle made him a more credible threat in the league. In 2017, he teamed up with Tipsy D for the Dos Por Dos 3 Tournament and they were able to reach the finals.",
