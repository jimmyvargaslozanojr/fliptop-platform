  "description": "M Zhayt proved that he’s a solid freestyler when he became champion at FlipTop Process of Illumination 4. When he made his debut at Second Sight 2, he showed everyone that his writtens are as good as his off-the-dome rhymes. M Zhayt often switches from freestyle to writtens and vice versa, making him a truly unpredictable emcee. He’s also effective in 2-on-2 battles, which is obvious at the 2017 Dos Por Dos Tournament. With their undeniable chemistry, he and Shernan beat Tipsy D and Sinio to become the undisputed champions.",
