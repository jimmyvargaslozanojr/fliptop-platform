  "description": "LilJohn was already killing it in freestyle battles way before FlipTop began. So when he joined Process of Illumination 4 in 2014, he was able to reach the finals and became co-champion (with M Zhayt) easily. He even joined the Process of Illumination 5 in Cebu just for fun and won the championship as well.",
