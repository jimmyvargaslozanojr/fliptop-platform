  "description": "Dello made his debut at the first Second Sight and even though he lost, the audience was still captivated by his jokes and multi-syllabic rhymes. He then showed his off-the-dome skills in his battle with Target at the inaugural Ahon event. Dello proved that despite of the modern format of battle rap, you can still win by freestyling. It was the night where he was crowned the official “rebuttal king” of FlipTop.",
