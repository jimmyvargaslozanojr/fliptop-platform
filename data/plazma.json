  "description": "Plazma started out in the English Conference, giving a solid performance at FlipTop’s first Second Sight event. While other emcees rely mostly on bars and jokes, Plazma stays true to his “Horrorcore” style of battling. In every match, the QC-born emcee will come up with different ways of killing you in the most graphic manner. You can see him go full serial killer mode in his Tectonics 2 battle versus USA’s Tantrum. His blood-drenched lines became more appreciated when he finally joined the Filipino Conference in 2016.",
