  "description": "Flict-G is another name that comes to mind when talking about the best speed rappers in the country. Just like Smugglaz, he was already spitting rapid fire flows way before the league started. So when FlipTop finally began, Flict-G was invited to compete at the Down N South event. He was unsuccessful in his debut match, but in 2012, he came back with an improved pen game and flow. Since then, Flict-g continues to make an impact in every battle that he’s in.",
